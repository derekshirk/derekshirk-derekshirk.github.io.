I’ve worked on a wide array or projects ranging from environmental brand design to designing and developing web and mobile-web experiences.

My most recent experience of selling the company I co-founded in 2009, Brewhouse,  leaves me exploring new opportunities and working towards launching a few new projects this year.</p>

<p>I am currently focusing some of my energy on building a digital product for the WordPress plugin marketplace. The details of which I hope share in more detail soon. I have also been devoting more time to getting out and meeting new people and exploring new business and employment opportunities.
